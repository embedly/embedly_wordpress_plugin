The Embedly Plugin extends Wordpress's auto embed feature to give your blog more media types, video analytics, recommendation, and style options.

== Description ==

Enhance the default Wordpress embedding to get previews for any article,
including your own blog posts. You also get embeds for Gfycat, Twitch, Google
Maps, and Embedly’s growing list of [300+ supported
providers](http://embed.ly/providers).

You can customize the style of the embeds, to optimize for darker WP themes,
alignment, and width. In addition, social buttons can be added around the embeds
to make it easier to share content from your blog posts.

For most music and video players embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, SoundCloud)
you can receive analytics on viewer behaviors. See which videos are being
watched and for how long.


Using it is as simple as the default Wordpress embedding. Embed media by pasting its URL in a single line when writing a post:

    This Embedly lets me embed everything great on the web!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=
Is this plugin for me?
=

Yes

=
Where do I get a key?
=

You can obtain a key when sign up for an Embedly account through the plugin. You
can also get your key anytime by going to your [Embedly
account](http://app.embed.ly).

=
How do I embed "any" URL?
=

In the post editor, once the plugin is installed, paste in the URL you are

=
What happens after I deactivate the plugin or delete my Embedly account?
=

Cards will remain active even if you delete the plugin and/or delete your Embedly account.  This happens
because after we generate a card for your post, it is converted into static HTML.  This HTML gets saved
to the post.  Removing the plugin has no effect on posts that were created in the past.

I updated a setting for an embed but the embed didn't reflect the change?

Advanced Settings only affect newly generated cards.  If you wish to change the appearance of a pre-existing
card, you will have to recreate the card in the post editor after making any settings changes.
