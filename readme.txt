Embed videos, images and rich media from 73 sources with just the url.

== Description ==

The [Embedly](http://embed.ly) plugin allows bloggers to embed videos, images and rich media from
73 sources with just the url. It uses the [Embedly API](http://api.embed.ly) to
get the embed code and display it in a post. This Plugin extends the 
[Embeds](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) framework in Wordpress 2.9. 

Write your post as normal, putting the url to the content you want to embed on
a single line like so:

    This Embedly lets me embed everything great on the web!
